Starting agent with instruction:

I've loaded an image for you to analyze. Consider the following question about the image:

<question>

    Look at the image and identify the colors in each quadrant of the image.
    What color is in the top-left quadrant? What color is in the top-right quadrant?
    What color is in the bottom-left quadrant? What color is in the bottom-right quadrant?
    
</question>

Can you help me analyze this image and answer the question?

Your task is to thoroughly investigate the image to provide the most accurate answer to the question.

Follow these steps to analyze the image:
1. Review the list of images in the workspace (provided automatically with every message)
2. Select the image to get basic information about it (size, format, etc.)
3. Create views (crops) of specific regions of interest in the image
4. Analyze each view in detail and describe what you see
5. Mark regions as analyzed by blacking them out when you're done with them
6. Provide a comprehensive answer to the question based on your analysis

Available Image Tools:
- select_image: Select an image or view to get information about it
- crop_image: Create a new view by cropping with coordinates (x1, y1, x2, y2)
- blackout_image: Black out a view to mark it as analyzed

NOTE: A list of all images and views in the workspace is automatically included in every message.

TIPS:
- Be methodical in your analysis, examining the image section by section
- Create multiple views to focus on different parts of the image
- Be detailed in your descriptions of what you see in each view
- Consider the context and purpose of the image when answering the question
- If the image contains text, make sure to read and report it accurately
- DO NOT repeatedly select the same image - select it once, then use crop_image to analyze specific regions
- After selecting an image, move on to creating views with crop_image to analyze specific parts
- When you're done with your analysis, use the complete tool to submit your final answer
