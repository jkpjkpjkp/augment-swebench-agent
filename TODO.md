i wish to for my purpose also include SequentialThinking Tool


Sequential Thinking Tool Usage: The SequentialThinkingTool is one of the tools available to the Agent, as seen in  tools/agent.py:
tools
self.tools = [
    bash_tool,
    StrReplaceEditorTool(workspace_manager=workspace_manager),
    SequentialThinkingTool(),
    self.complete_tool,
]
It's designed to help the agent break down complex problems into smaller steps. The tool maintains a history of thoughts and can:

Track numbered thoughts (thoughtNumber/totalThoughts)
Allow revisions of previous thoughts
Support branching thought paths
Help with step-by-step analysis
Agent and Sequential Thinking Relationship: The sequential thinking tool doesn't spawn new agents. Instead, it's a tool used by a single agent to structure its thinking process. When multiple agents are running (as seen in  run_agent_on_swebench_problem.py), they run in parallel using a process pool:
File Modification Concurrency: For concurrent file modifications, the code uses locks and semaphores to prevent conflicts:
A threading lock is passed to each agent process
The workspace setup is protected by the lock:
utils
Additionally, the StrReplaceEditorTool maintains a file history for each modified file:

This allows for:

Tracking changes
Undoing modifications
Maintaining file history per agent
Safe concurrent access through locks
The combination of process-level parallelism with proper locking mechanisms ensures that multiple agents can work safely in the same workspace without file conflicts.
