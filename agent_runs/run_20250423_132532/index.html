<p><br>I've loaded an image for you to analyze. Consider the following question about the image:<br><br><question><br>How many geese are there in total?<br></question><br><br>Can you help me analyze this image and answer the question?<br><br>Your task is to thoroughly investigate the image to provide the most accurate answer to the question.<br><br>Follow these steps to analyze the image:<br>1. Review the list of images in the workspace (provided automatically with every message)<br>2. Select the image to get basic information about it (size, format, etc.)<br>3. Create views (crops) of specific regions of interest in the image<br>4. Analyze each view in detail and describe what you see<br>5. Mark regions as analyzed by blacking them out when you're done with them<br>6. Provide an accurate answer to the question based on your analysis<br><br>Available Image Tools:<br>- select_image: Select an image from the "Available images" list shown at the beginning of each message<br>- crop_image: Create a new view by cropping the currently displayed image with a bounding box [x1, y1, x2, y2] in normalized coordinates [0-1000]<br>- blackout_image: Black out a view to mark it as analyzed<br><br>TIPS:<br>- Be methodical in your analysis, examining the image section by section<br>- Create multiple views to focus on different parts of the image<br>- Be detailed in your descriptions of what you see in each view<br>- But only report information relavent to the question<br>- Consider the context and purpose of the image when answering the question<br>- Zoom in by repeatedly cropping, until you have a very clear view of the region of interest<br>- If the image contains text, make sure to read and report it accurately<br>- If you are done with an image, black it out before selecting another one. This will help you keep track of which parts of the image you have already analyzed.<br>- When you black out a view, it is automatically deleted along with any other fully black views<br>- The smallest remaining view (with the least number of pixels) is identified for further analysis<br>- DO NOT repeatedly select the same image - select it once, then use crop_image to analyze specific regions<br>- After selecting an image, move on to creating views with crop_image to analyze specific parts<br><br>Example workflow:<br>1. First select an image: `select_image(image_path="37_3.png")`<br>2. Then crop a region: `crop_image(bbox=[0, 0, 500, 500])` (top-left quarter)<br>3. Analyze what you see in the cropped view<br>4. Create more crops as needed: `crop_image(bbox=[500, 0, 1000, 500])` (top-right quarter)<br>5. When done with your analysis, use the complete tool to submit your final answer<br></p>
