Consider the following question about the image:\n\n<question>\nHow many geese are there in total?\n</question>\n\nCan you help me analyze this image and answer the question?\n\nYour task is to thoroughly investigate the image to provide the most accurate answer to the question.\n\nExample steps:\n1. Create views (crops) of specific regions of interest in the image\n2. Analyze each view in detail and jot down information related to the <question>\n3. Mark regions as analyzed by blacking them out\n4. Only report a final answer when you are absolutely sure based on your analysis.\n\nTIPS:\n- Be methodical in your analysis, examining the image section by section\n- Create multiple views to focus on different parts of the image\n- Be detailed in your descriptions of what you see in each view\n- But only report relavent information to the question\n- Zoom in by repeatedly cropping, until you have a very clear view of the region of interest\n- If you are done with an image, black it out before switching to another one. This helps you keep track of which parts of the image you have already analyzed.\n",
