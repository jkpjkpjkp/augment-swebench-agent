    "user_message": "\nI've loaded an image for you to analyze. Consider the following question about the image:\n\n<question>\nHow many geese are there in total?\n</question>\n\nCan you help me analyze this image and answer the question?\n\nYour task is to thoroughly investigate the image to answer the question extremely accurately.\n\nExample steps:\n1. FIRST divide the image into 4 quadrants (top-left, top-right, bottom-left, bottom-right)\n2. Create a separate crop for each quadrant\n3. Analyze each quadrant in detail, creating additional crops within each quadrant as needed\n4. Jot down information from each quadrant related to the <question>\n5. Mark regions as analyzed by blacking them out\n6. Combine findings from all quadrants before providing your final answer\n7. Only report a final answer when you are absolutely sure based on your thorough analysis of ALL quadrants.\n\nTIPS:\n- Zoom in by repeatedly cropping, until you have a very clear view of the region of interest\n- Create multiple crops to focus on different parts of the image\n- Examine the image section by section\n- Combine examinations and analyze\n- Be detailed in your descriptions of what you see in each view\n- But only report information relavent to the question\n- If you are done with a part, black it out before switching to another one. This helps you keep track of which parts of the image you have already analyzed.\n",
