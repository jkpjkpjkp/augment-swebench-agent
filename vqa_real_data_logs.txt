Starting agent with instruction:

I've loaded an image for you to analyze. Consider the following question about the image:

<question>
How many geese are there in total?
</question>

Can you help me analyze this image and answer the question?

Your task is to thoroughly investigate the image to answer the question extremely accurately.

Example steps:
0. Zoom-in (cut away unrelated area)
1. Divide complex images into multiple parts (ALWAYS a good idea)
2. You may divide them into equal parts, or small, tight bounding boxes of objects of interest
3. Analyze each view in detail and remember information related to the <question> in curly braces
4. Mark regions as analyzed by blacking them out
5. Only report a final answer when you are absolutely sure, based on your analysis.
6. Only information in curly braces will be remembered between calls

TIPS:
- Zoom in by repeatedly cropping, until you have a very clear view of the region of interest
- Create multiple crops to focus on different parts of the image
- Examine the image section by section
- Combine examinations and analyze
- Be detailed in your descriptions of what you see in each view
- But only report information relevant to the question
- If you are done with a part, black it out before switching to another one. This helps you keep track of which parts of the image you have already analyzed.
