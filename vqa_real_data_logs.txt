Starting agent with instruction:

I've loaded an image for you to analyze. Consider the following question about the image:

<question>
How many geese are there in total?
</question>

Can you help me analyze this image and answer the question?

Your task is to thoroughly investigate the image to provide the most accurate answer to the question.

Example steps:
1. Create views (crops) of specific regions of interest in the image
2. Analyze each view in detail and jot down information related to the <question>
3. Mark regions as analyzed by blacking them out
4. Only report a final answer when you are absolutely sure based on your analysis.

TIPS:
- Be methodical in your analysis, examining the image section by section
- Create multiple views to focus on different parts of the image
- Be detailed in your descriptions of what you see in each view
- But only report relavent information to the question
- Zoom in by repeatedly cropping, until you have a very clear view of the region of interest
- If you are done with an image, black it out before switching to another one. This helps you keep track of which parts of the image you have already analyzed.
