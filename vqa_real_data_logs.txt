Starting agent with instruction:

I've loaded an image for you to analyze. Consider the following question about the image:

<question>
How many geese are there in total?
</question>

Can you help me analyze this image and answer the question?

Your task is to thoroughly investigate the image to answer the question extremely accurately.

Example steps:
0. Zoom-in (cut away unrelated area)
1. dividing complex images into multiple parts is ALWAYS a good idea
2. you may divide them into equal parts, or one-by-one black out objects of interest
3. Analyze each view in detail and jot down information related to the <question>
4. Mark regions as analyzed by blacking them out
5. Only report a final answer when you are absolutely sure based on your analysis.

TIPS:
- Zoom in by repeatedly cropping, until you have a very clear view of the region of interest
- Create multiple crops to focus on different parts of the image
- Examine the image section by section
- Combine examinations and analyze
- Be detailed in your descriptions of what you see in each view
- But only report information relavent to the question
- If you are done with a part, black it out before switching to another one. This helps you keep track of which parts of the image you have already analyzed.
